- always update the PROJECT.md file when something changes or on new info. 
- manage the PROJECT.md file in a MVP 80/20 style - I want to get to users fast - optimise later so no fluff, most effective things first.
- I like nested structures (like nested todos, nested folder structure)
- I do have .env file!! just asume i have it, you don't see it because it's gitignoreed
- When adding new features or improving existing ones, prioritize maintaining Heroku compatibility
- Keep session management portable (always use the session_manager.py approach to ensure persistence)
- Document any changes to environment variables in both README.md and PROJECT.md
- Maintain a clean separation between local development and production deployment
- For Heroku deployment changes, always update setup_heroku.sh to reflect new environment variables
- Keep export_session.py up-to-date for session management

## HEROKU ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE UPDATES
**NEVER manually set Heroku config vars with `heroku config:set`!**
**ALWAYS use the dedicated setup script: `./setup_heroku.sh`**

The setup_heroku.sh script:
- Automatically reads from both .env (secrets) and app_settings.env (settings)
- Deploys ALL environment variables to Heroku in one command
- Handles session compression and state management
- Cleans up obsolete variables
- Is the ONLY way to update Heroku environment variables

When environment variables change:
1. Update .env (for secrets like API keys) or app_settings.env (for settings)
2. Run `./setup_heroku.sh` to deploy to Heroku
3. Check `heroku logs --tail --app nyt-zoomer-bot` to verify deployment
