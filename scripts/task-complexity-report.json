      "taskTitle": "Implement Success Metrics Monitoring",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of success metrics monitoring into subtasks covering metrics identification, logging infrastructure, alerting setup, translation improvements, message formatting changes, code refactoring for translation style, and comprehensive testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves both backend (metrics tracking, logging, alerting) and frontend (message formatting, translation style, tone adjustment) changes, as well as code refactoring and testing. The need to coordinate multiple improvements and ensure they work together increases complexity. Additional subtasks are needed for metric definition, alert configuration, code changes, and validation."

      "taskTitle": "Develop Future Enhancements Framework",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the framework development into subtasks for requirements gathering, framework design, CI/CD pipeline setup, image generation reliability improvements, prompt engineering, and documentation for future enhancements.",
      "reasoning": "The task requires architectural planning for extensibility, CI/CD integration, and improvements to a complex subsystem (image generation). It also involves troubleshooting, quality improvements, and ensuring symbolic relevance, which together require careful coordination and modularization."

      "taskTitle": "Create User Documentation",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide documentation into subtasks for setup instructions, feature usage guides, troubleshooting, FAQs, and review/validation of documentation accuracy.",
      "reasoning": "While documentation is less technically complex, it covers a broad range of features and requires clarity, completeness, and validation. The main challenge is ensuring all advanced features are well-documented and instructions are accurate."

      "taskTitle": "Conduct Final Quality Assurance",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand QA into subtasks for code review, end-to-end testing, CI/CD validation, error recovery testing, performance monitoring setup, documentation review, and production readiness assessment.",
      "reasoning": "Final QA is inherently complex, requiring comprehensive review of code, functionality, performance, and deployment processes. It also involves advanced error handling and system stability checks, necessitating multiple focused subtasks."

      "taskTitle": "Organize Project Structure and Clean Up Root Directory",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the project organization into subtasks for directory creation, file migration, configuration file evaluation, reference updates, and verification of script functionality.",
      "reasoning": "This is a straightforward organizational task with clear steps, but it requires careful attention to detail to avoid breaking references or scripts. The main complexity lies in ensuring all dependencies and documentation are updated correctly."
